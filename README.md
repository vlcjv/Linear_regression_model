Linear Regression Model on the Diabetes Dataset

This model predicts a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline using the Diabetes Dataset from scikit-learn. The dataset contains 10 baseline variables, such as age, sex, BMI, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements, as features for the prediction.
Key Model Details:

    Model Type: Linear Regression
    Features: 10 predictors including age, BMI, and blood pressure.
    Performance Metrics:
        Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2605.66
        This indicates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
        R-squared (R²): 0.48
        This shows the model explains 48% of the variance in disease progression, indicating moderate performance.

Coefficients:

    The coefficients represent the impact of each feature on the target variable. For example:
        Positive coefficients (e.g., 30.94 for age30.94 for age) suggest a direct correlation.
        Negative coefficients (e.g., −204.03 for sex−204.03 for sex) suggest an inverse correlation.

Insights:

This linear regression model provides a baseline understanding of how various health metrics influence disease progression. While the model captures some variability (R2=0.48R2=0.48), further improvements could be achieved by exploring non-linear models or feature engineering.
